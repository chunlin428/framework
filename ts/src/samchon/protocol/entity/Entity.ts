	 * I say repeatedly. Expression method of Entity is recommended, but not imposed. It's a semi
	 * protocol for network I/O but not a essential protocol must be kept. The expression method of
	 * Entity, using on network I/O, is expressed by XML string.

	 * If your own network system has a critical performance issue on communication data class, 
	 * it would be better to using binary communication (with ByteArray).
	 * Don't worry about the problem! Invoke also provides methods for binary data (ByteArray).
