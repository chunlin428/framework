	/**
	 * The IEventDispatcher interface defines methods for adding or removing event listeners, checks whether specific 
	 * types of event listeners are registered, and dispatches events.
	 *
	 * The event target serves as the local point for how events flow through the display list hierarchy. When an 
	 * event such as a mouse click or a key press occurs, an event object is dispatched into the event flow from the 
	 * root of the display list. The event object makes a round-trip journey to the event target, which is 
	 * conceptually divided into three phases: the capture phase includes the journey from the root to the last node 
	 * before the event target's node; the target phase includes only the event target node; and the bubbling phase 
	 * includes any subsequent nodes encountered on the return trip to the root of the display list.
	 * 
	 * In general, the easiest way for a user-defined class to gain event dispatching capabilities is to extend 
	 * {@link EventDispatcher}. If this is impossible (that is, if the class is already extending another class), you 
	 * can instead implement the {@link IEventDispatcher} interface, create an {@link EventDispatcher} member, and 
	 * write simple hooks to route calls into the aggregated {@link EventDispatcher}.

		 * priority level.
		 *
		 * Keep in mind that after the listener is registered, subsequent calls to {@link addEventListener} with a

		 * if you first register a listener with useCapture set to true, it listens only during the capture phase. If 
		 * you call {@link addEventListener} again using the same listener object, but with useCapture set to false,

		 * 
		 * If you no longer need an event listener, remove it by calling {@link removeEventListener}, or memory

		 * If the event listener is being registered on a node while an event is also being processed on this node,
