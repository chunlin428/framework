	 * @brief A genetic algorithm class
	 * 
	 * @details
	 * <p> In the field of artificial intelligence, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic 
	 * that mimics the process of natural selection. This heuristic (also sometimes called a metaheuristic) 
	 * is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems. </p>
	 * 
	 * <p> Genetic algorithms belong to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA), which generate 
	 * solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as 
	 * inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover. </p>

	 *
	 * @warning
	 * <p> Be careful for the mistakes of direction or position of Compare. </p>
	 * <p> Most of logical errors failed to access optimal solution are occured by those mistakens. </p>
	 *
	 * @tparam GeneArray An array(std::vector) containing genes as elments; sequnce listing.
	 *					 The GeneArray must be a type of <i>std::vector</i>.
	 *
	 * @tparam Compare
	 *	<p> A comparison class (or struct) returns whether left gene is more optimal. </p>
	 *
	 *	<p> Default template parameter of Compare is <i>std::less<GeneArray></i>. It means to compare
	 *	two std::vector (GeneArray must be a std::vector). Thus, you've to keep follwing rules. </p>
	 *
	 *	<p> If you don't want to follow the rules or want a custom comparison class, you have to
	 *	realize a comparison class. The following code is an example realizing the comparison class. </p>
	 *
	 *		- GeneArray is inherited from <i>std::vector</i>
	 *		- GeneArray has custom <i>auto operator<(const GeneArray &) const -> bool</i>
