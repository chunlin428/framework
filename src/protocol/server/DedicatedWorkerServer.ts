/**
 * A DeidcatedWorker server.
 *
 * The {@link DedicatedWorkerServer} is an abstract class is realized to open a DedicatedWorker server and accept 
 * web-browser client (master). Extends this {@link DedicatedWorkerServer} class and overrides 
 * {@link addClient addClient()} method to define what to do with a newly connected 
 * {@link DedicatedWorkerClientDriver remote client}.
 * 
 * #### Why DedicatedWorker be a server?
 * In JavaScript environment, there's no way to implement multi-threading function. Instead, JavaScript supports the
 * **Worker**, creating a new process. However, the **Worker** does not shares memory addresses. To integrate the
 * **Worker** with its master, only communication with string or binary data is allowed. Doesn't it seem like a network
 * communication? Furthermore, there's not any difference between the worker communication and network communication.
 * It's the reason why Samchon Framework considers the **Worker** as a network node.
 *
 * The class {@link DedicatedWorkerCommunicator} is designed make such relationship. From now on, DedicatedWorker is a
 * {@link DedicatedWorkerServer server} and {@link DedicatedWorkerServerConnector browser} is a client. Integrate the
 * server and clients with this {@link DedicatedWorkerCommunicator}.
 * 
 * #### [Inherited] {@link IServer}
