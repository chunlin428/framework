/**
 * A SharedWorker server.
 *
 * The {@link SharedWorker} is an abstract class is realized to open a SharedWorker server and accept web-browser 
 * clients. Extends this {@link SharedWorkerServer} class and overrides {@link addClient addClient()} method to 
 * define what to do with newly connected {@link SharedWorkerClientDriver remote clients}.
 * 
 * #### Why SharedWorker be a server?
 * SharedWorker, it allows only an instance (process) to be created whether the SharedWorker is declared in a browser
 * or multiple browsers. To integrate them, messages are being sent and received. Doesn't it seem like a relationship
 * between a server and clients? Thus, Samchon Framework consider the SharedWorker as a server and browsers as
 * clients.
 *
 * The class {@link SharedWorkerCommunicator} is designed make such relationship. From now on, SharedWorker is a
 * {@link SharedWorkerServer server} and {@link SharedWorkerServerConnector browsers} are clients. Integrate the
 * server and clients with this {@link SharedWorkerCommunicator}.
 * 
 * #### [Inherited] {@link IServer}
