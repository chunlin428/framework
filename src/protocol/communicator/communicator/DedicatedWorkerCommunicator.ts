/**
 * A communicator for shared worker.
 * 
 * {@link DedicatedWorkerCommunicator} is an abstract class for communication between DedicatedWorker and Web-browser. 
 * This {@link DedicatedWorkerCommunicator} is specified to {@link DedicatedWorkerServerConnector} and 
 * {@link DedicatedWorkerClientDriver} whether the remote system is a server (that my system is connecting to) or a 
 * client (a client conneting to to my server).
 * 
 * #### Why DedicatedWorker be a server?
 * In JavaScript environment, there's no way to implement multi-threading function. Instead, JavaScript supports the
 * **Worker**, creating a new process. However, the **Worker** does not shares memory addresses. To integrate the 
 * **Worker** with its master, only communication with string or binary data is allowed. Doesn't it seem like a network
 * communication? Furthermore, there's not any difference between the worker communication and network communication. 
 * It's the reason why Samchon Framework considers the **Worker** as a network node.
 * 
 * The class {@link DedicatedWorkerCommunicator} is designed make such relationship. From now on, DedicatedWorker is a 
 * {@link DedicatedWorkerServer server} and {@link DedicatedWorkerServerConnector browser} is a client. Integrate the 
 * server and clients with this {@link DedicatedWorkerCommunicator}.
 * 
 * #### [Inherited] {@link ICommunicator}
