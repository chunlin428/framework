/**
 * A server connector for SharedWorker.
 *
 * {@link SharedWorkerServerConnector} is a class connecting to SharedWorker and taking full charge of network 
 * communication with the SharedWorker. Create an {@link SharedWorkerServerConnector} instance from the
 * {@IProtocol listener} and call the {@link connect connect()} method.
 * 
 * #### Why SharedWorker be a server?
 * SharedWorker, it allows only an instance (process) to be created whether the SharedWorker is declared in a browser
 * or multiple browsers. To integrate them, messages are being sent and received. Doesn't it seem like a relationship
 * between a server and clients? Thus, Samchon Framework consider the SharedWorker as a server and browsers as
 * clients.
 *
 * The class {@link SharedWorkerCommunicator} is designed make such relationship. From now on, SharedWorker is a
 * {@link SharedWorkerServer server} and {@link SharedWorkerServerConnector browsers} are clients. Integrate the
 * server and clients with this {@link SharedWorkerCommunicator}.
